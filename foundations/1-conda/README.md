# Activate Conda Environment

First, read the [Conda Intro](CondaIntro.md).

Then, return to this page to activate your Conda environment.

## Activate the environment

In a new terminal ('Terminal' menu top left), run:
```plain
conda activate storehouse
```

You should now see `(storehouse)` where previously `(base)` appeared next to your path.
