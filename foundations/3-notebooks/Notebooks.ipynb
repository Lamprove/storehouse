    "In a Jupyter Notebook, you can create different types of cells, such as code cells and markdown cells. Code cells contain executable code, while markdown cells contain text, equations, or images.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   To **add a new cell**, click on the \"+\" button in the notebook toolbar (or by hovering below the middle of each cell) or press `Shift + Enter` after selecting a cell.\n",
    "*   To **change the cell type**, click on the cell type indicator in the bottom right of each cell (this cell should say \"Markdown\") and choose the desired cell type from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "*   To **run a code cell**, click on the Play button to the left of each cell or press `Shift + Enter` while the cell is selected. The output will appear below the cell.\n",
    "Try it! Run the next cell and view the output. \n"
